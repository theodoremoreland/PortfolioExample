                    <p>
                        My passion for programming started when I was accepted into LaunchCode's free coding bootcamp (Lc101) in 2018.
                        After just a few classes, I knew that I wanted a career in software development.
                        Post graduation, I maintained momentum by enrolling in another coding bootcamp. This time, the course was an offering
                        from Washington University in Saint Louis and Trilogy Education. I graduated my second coding bootcamp then became
                        a Teaching Assistant for LaunchCode during their 2019 and 2021 cohorts, in between which, I worked as an IT Consultant for
                        Daugherty Business Solutions. Immediately after my second stint as a TA at
                        LaunchCode, I became a Teaching Assistant for Southern Methodist University's Full Stack coding bootcamp.
