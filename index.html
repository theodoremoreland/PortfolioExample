                    <h2>About me</h2>
                    <p>
                        I started programming in 2018 upon attending LaunchCode's free coding boot camp.
                        After my first few classes, I realized I had a passion for software development.
                        Post graduation, I maintained my momentum by staying involved in programming academically and professionally.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In 2019, I enrolled in a Bachelor's Degree program at Lindenwood University and a Data Analytics
                        boot camp at Washington University. After graduating my second coding boot camp, I went on to
                        work as an IT Consultant at Daugherty Business Solutions. During my time at Daugherty, I contributed
                        as a Data Engineer, Full Stack Developer, and Mobile Developer. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In between college classes and my work as an IT Consultant,
                        I also worked as a Teaching Assistant across two coding bootcamps and three cohorts, twice as a TA for
                        LaunchCode's Lc101, once as a TA for Southern Methodist University's Full Stack
                        Flex.
